                <p>Learning anything for the first time is challenging, it is fun then it is difficult, then it is awful and you think you'll never do it but keep going, evry small step is a step closer to your goal.<br> You will never be great until you learn to be vulnerable, learn to fail and learn from mistakes, it doesn't get easier, but you do get better</p> </div>
 
             <div class="advice two"><h4>Always be Curious</h4>
                <p>Be passonate about learning and take delight in the endless exploration of life and the process of learning a new skill.</p></div>
